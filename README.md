## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover patterns in ride distribution, peak hours, and geospatial trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights into user behavior and operational efficiency.

## **Problem Statement**

How can we leverage Uber trip data to understand user demand, optimize routes, and identify peak times for better resource allocation?

## **Dataset Description**

Source: Uber dataset for September 2014  
**Dataset** : [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirmotefaker/uber-trips-analysis)

## **Features:**
Date/Time: Trip timestamp
Lat: Latitude of the pickup
Lon: Longitude of the pickup
Base: Uber base code

## **Technologies Used**

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Folium, Scikit-learn

## **Data Cleaning**

- Removed duplicates.
- Handled missing values.
- Identified and removed outliers using the IQR method.

## Key Steps in Analysis.

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted features such as `hour`, `day_of_week`, and `month` from the `Date/Time` column.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Bar plots for trips by hour and day
   - Geospatial scatter plots and heatmaps for pickup and dropoff locations.
   - Correlation heatmap among numerical features.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Computed descriptive statistics and explored feature distributions.

## **Insights**

- **Peak Trip Demand (5 PM to 8 PM):** Trip demand is highest during evening rush hours, indicating that this is when most users need rides, likely due to after-work commutes and evening activities.

- **Saturdays Have the Highest Number of Trips:** Uber experiences the highest trip frequency on Saturdays, which could be linked to weekend activities and events.

- **Pickups Concentrated in Urban Centers:** Most pickups are happening in densely populated areas, likely due to the higher concentration of businesses, residences, and entertainment options.

- **Strong Correlation Between Hour and Trip Counts:** There is a clear relationship between the time of day and the number of trips, suggesting that trip volume fluctuates predictably based on the hour.

##  **Recommendations:**
- **Optimize Driver Availability(5 PM to 8 PM):** Increase the number of drivers during peak hours to ensure shorter wait times and meet demand efficiently.
- **Weekend Fleet Expansion(Saturdays):** Since Saturdays see the highest trip demand, ensure a higher fleet availability on this day, particularly in the afternoon and evening.
- **Urban Center Focus:** Deploy more drivers in urban areas where pickups are concentrated, ensuring faster response times and better coverage of high-demand locations.
- **Dynamic Pricing Based on Time of Day:** Implement dynamic pricing during peak hours to manage demand and optimize earnings, while also considering promotions during low-demand hours.
